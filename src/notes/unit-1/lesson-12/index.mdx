## Minimum Spanning Tree

![Graph](https://code.org/curriculum/docs/csp/U2L06-graph-1.png)

Our goal with this is to determine what the 'cheapest' connections we can build to ensure that every node is 
connected to every other node. 

There are two very famous algorithms ([Prim's Algorithm][2], and [Kruskal's Algorithm][3]) that can be used to determine 
the optimal solution. 

To watch each of these algorithms in action go to the [Visualgo Website][1]
