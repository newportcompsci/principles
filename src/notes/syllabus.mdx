# Welcome to AP Computer Science Principles!

## Course Overview

Welcome to AP Computer Science Principles! In today’s modern world an understanding 
of Computer Science is invaluable. Whether or not you want to go on to one day 
work in the technology industry a survey of computer science is going to serve 
you well in becoming an informed consumer. Going into this course I will assume 
absolutely no prior computer science experience. So, if you can’t tell a bit from 
a byte or think that Java is just a name we give our coffee this class is right 
for you if you’re willing to put in the effort. My first goal in this class is 
to help you become an informed consumer and to walk away with a broad understanding 
of the global impacts that computing can have in today’s world. My second goal 
is to prepare everyone to succeed on the AP test. I’m super excited to go on this 
journey with you this year, and I hope you are too! 

## Skills and Prerequisites

This class does not require any prior experience in computer programming. However, 
there are a few skills that I expect all students to know: 

- A basic understanding of how to use a computer (using a mouse and keyboard, 
  as well as knowing how to open and name files) 
- Basic algebra and problem-solving skills 
- Basic written communication skills 
- An ability to learn from your mistakes  
- PERSISTENCE!  

## Course Materials :computer:

- **Computer**: Students will be issued a school laptop which is perfectly suitable 
  for everything we will be doing in this class.  
- **Notebook/Pen**: I expect all students to write their notes in a physical 
  notebook throughout the lessons. 
- **College Board Account**: I highly encourage all students to take the AP 
  exam at the end of the year. If you plan on taking the test you are required 
  to set up an account on the College Board site and know your sign-in.  
- **[Code.org Account](https://code.org)**: This will be performed in class on the first or second day. 
  Students will have to create an account on code.org for the Principles class, 
  to access materials and resources. 

## Textbook 

There isn’t one! Yay! :sunglasses: :thumbsup:

## The AP Exam

The APCS Principles class is very different from most AP courses, where 100% 
of the exam score is derived from an exam in May. APCS Principles in contrast, 
has 3 components that make up a student’s AP score: 

### Exam in May: 60% 

The exam will comprise 60% of a student’s grade for the AP course. 
The exam is 2 hours long, and composed of 74 multiple choice questions 
(No free response questions are in the exam). 

### Explore Performance Task: 16% 

The Explore Performance Task is a research activity that students must complete 
by April 30th. Student’s complete an activity in class and at home and turn in 
the work on the College Board website. We will be targeting completion of 1-2 
practice attempts at this task, AND the task itself by the end of the first 
semester. However, students will not be expected to officially turn in the task 
until the end of April. 

Rules for performance tasks are very clear: 
- No late tasks are accepted (NO submissions are accepted by the college board 
  after April 30th) 
- Teachers and parents CANNOT help students with the task: it must be their own 
  work. We of course can help prepare students to complete the task well, before 
  the task is started 
- *Note*: once the task is submitted to the college board, the task can, and 
  will be graded 
- Teachers **MUST** provide 8 hours of class time to complete the task. I will 
  be planning on making more time than that available, but that is the specified 
  minimum requirement. Students may work as much as they wish at home on the task 

### Create Performance Task: 24% 

The Create Performance Task is a creative activity that students must complete 
by April 30th. Student’s complete an activity in class and at home and turn in 
the work on the College Board website. We will be targeting completion of 1-2 
practice attempts at this task, AND the task itself by the end of March, leaving 
time for students to polish the task if they wish. Students will not be expected 
to officially turn in the task until the end of April. 

As above, rules for performance tasks are very clear: 
- No late tasks are accepted (NO submissions are accepted by the college board 
  after April 30th) 
- Teachers and parents CANNOT help students with the task: it must be their own 
  work. We of course can help prepare students to complete the task well, before 
  the task is started 
- *Note*: once the task is submitted to the college board, the task can, and will 
  be graded 
- Teachers **MUST** provide 12 hours of class time to complete the task. I will 
  be planning on making more time than that available, but that is the specified 
  minimum requirement. Students may work as much as they wish at home on the task

## Workload 

This is an AP level course that offers college credit and as such I expect students 
to treat this class as one. While most of the class will be light on homework, 
there will be 2 key activities (and practice activities) where homework will be 
more intense. Please be aware of the upcoming schedule for those components, and 
plan accordingly. If you feel yourself falling behind at any point in the class, 
please communicate that with me as soon as possible so I can work with you to be 
successful.  

 
### In-Class Activities – 20% 

Like stated above, there isn’t any homework that will be explicitly assigned. 
Rather the type of work that this class is built upon is the in-class activities 
that will be a daily occurrence. I will not be grading every activity, but instead 
I will typically grade about two of the activities each week based on a more 
completion-based assessment. My goal for assigning this grade is to award students 
for participating in class and giving the in-class activities an honest attempt 
at practicing the new content that we will be learning.  

If a student is absent for an activity they need to come talk to be so that we 
can figure out how they might be able to make one up. This might comprise of the 
student trying to do the activity on their own, or I might just assign something 
different depending on the circumstances.  

### Projects – 45% 

There will be about 2 projects or performance tasks per unit that allow the 
students to practice style the performance tasks that they will see on the actual 
AP exam. These practice tasks will be about 25 points. After the actual 
performance tasks are turned in to college board I will assign a grade for those 
projects to the student. For each of the real performance tasks the student will 
receive 100 points.  

Unlike homework, projects can be accepted late at a cost. You can expect to lose 
about 5% per day for late work capped at 20% meaning that the most you can earn 
is an 80% on the project turned in more than 4 days late. If the project is going 
to be turned in more than 4 days late you MUST communicate with me to make a new 
timeline. Remember, it is ALWAYS better to turn in late work than not at all! 

### Tests/Quizzes – 35% 

A test or quiz will be given at the end of each unit. Quizzes will cover only the 
material from the most recent unit, while tests will cover material from multiple 
units. The exact material covered will be announced prior to each test or quiz. 
Vocabulary quizzes will be on needed basis and can be pop quizzes. 

I don’t allow for retakes (unless under special circumstances). However, if you 
were absent on the day of the test you MUST schedule a time with me to take it.  

## Expectations 

Students are expected to behave appropriately always in class. Students must be 
attentive and ready to learn and should actively participate in classroom 
activities. This includes taking notes and asking questions during lecture time 
and working on assigned activities during lab time. Students are also expected 
to be paying attention and not using their computers during lectures and 
classroom discussions; computers must only be used during dedicated lab time and 
then only on assigned material. All assignments must be completed and turned in 
on time, and students must be proactive about speaking to the course staff about 
issues. In addition, all NHS rules and policies must be followed and respected 
always. 

### Cellphones :iphone:

Students are expected to put their phone in the pockets at the front of the room 
during class unless the teacher states otherwise. Phones can be picked up one 
minute before the bell rings at the end of class. Part of the professionalism 
points that students earn comes from students showing me when they come into the 
class each day they are here and ready to learn. Students show me this by telling 
me that they can live without their phone for the time they are in the classroom 
by placing it in the phone pockets. If a student doesn’t have a phone, all I ask 
is that they get their parents to email me or write a quick note indicating such.  

### Other Policies :hamburger:

- Food is not permitted in the classroom and drinks must be in a closed container 
- All content you create (text, images, etc.) must be school appropriate 
- Questions are ALWAYS welcome and are encouraged. Questioning shows that we 
  are wanting to learn and are making an honest attempt to uncover the truth of 
  a subject.
