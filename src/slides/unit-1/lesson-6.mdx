## Challenge 

> Groups must develop a protocol or set of rules for communicating a drawing to their partners using only bits.

Rules: 

<div style={{display: 'flex'}}>

- The image will be a line drawing created by connecting points on a grid, like the one seen here.
- The parties can discuss and agree on a protocol ahead of time, but the image exchange must happen without communication between the two parties, other than through using the Internet Simulator.
- You can only send a single message through the Internet Simulator to describe the whole image.

<img style={{height: '500px'}} src="https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3Ab9748b3414be53ab97f6b929826d2352fad2add45213a3a5d246c01b%2BIMAGE%2BIMAGE.1" />

</div>

## Wrap-Up

- Develop a protocol that allows the user to send a calendar date (mm/dd). What is the minimum number of bits necessary?

- Develop a protocol that allows the user to send a time (use 24hr military time hh:mm:ss). What is the minimum number of bits necessary?
