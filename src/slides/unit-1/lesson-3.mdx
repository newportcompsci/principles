# Sending Binary Messages with the Internet Simulator

---

## Vocabulary

- **Protocol**: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.
    - For our purposes today a "protocol" is simply a set of rules about sending, receiving and interpreting binary messages.

- **Bit**: A contraction of "Binary Digit"; the single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1
    - We will call each element of a binary message a bit. "Bit" is short for binary digit. So for example if you have a binary message A B B A, we would say that is a 4-bit message.

## Flashlight Test

"Imagine that you and your friend have made a binary signaling protocol using a flashlight. The light on is state A, off is state B."

## Test 1

"Your friend sends you this message. What is being signaled here? Write down what you think the message is."

> Discuss with your neighbor what you think the message is

---

## Test 2

"Uh oh! Your friend realizes she actually made a mistake encoding the message from before and decides to re-send the message. Decode this new version of the message and write it down."

> Discuss with your neighbor what you think the message is

---

## Discussion

- Did this new message make you think about your answer to the first question? Do you want to change your answer to the first question?
- What assumptions did you make in interpreting these messages?
- Is this protocol specific enough to allow useful communication of a binary message? If not what information would need to be added to it?

## The Internet Simulator

Get into groups of two and each of you need to navigate to Unit 1 Lesson 3 and start up the internet simulator. 

> I'm going to give you around 5 minutes to explore this tool and see what you can friend

> **Note** You cannot break this so don't be afraid to explore

## How does it work?

## Developing a Protocol

You and your partner need to design a *protocol* for sending a sequence of bits back and forth to each other

Start out with 2-bits and see if you can work your way up to 8-bits. 

Your protocol **MUST** recieve bits and send the same bits back.

---

## The 2-bit Message Challenge

- Each initial sender should be able to confirm that the message was received correctly and resent because the message that they have received is the same as the original.
- As students iterate and perfect their protocol, they should try to extend their protocol to send more bits or send them more quickly, while maintaining accuracy. When each group has a working protocol and has time to practice (~10 minutes), have an all-class showdown to see who can do it the fastest

---

### Rules: 

- Student pairs can decide who sends first.
- Teacher reveals sequence of bits to be sent. Partner A of each group may enter this sequence of bits into Internet Simulator but may not begin sending them.
- Teacher will say “GO” and partners will exchange messages.
- During the challenge students may not communicate with one another. (Note: feel free to put partners on opposite sides of a room or in separate rooms altogether.)
- Students yell “STOP” once they have completed their exchange.
- Teacher will verify that each partner received what the other sent by checking outgoing and incoming messages.

## Discussion

- How has today’s activity added to or altered your definition of a bit?
- A major focus of today’s activity was timing and coordination. What things did you need to coordinate or agree about ahead of time in order for your protocol to work?
- What is the best bit rate you were able to achieve? What would it take to go faster?
- How fast do you think computers transmit bits?
