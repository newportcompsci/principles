## Prompt

> What’s something that you know a lot about? Something that you could teach somebody?

- This doesn’t have to be a subject in school - it very well might not be.
- As a person, as an individual who is living and breathing in this world, there is something that you probably know a lot about - maybe you feel like you know more about than most people. What is that thing?

> Write your response on a sticky note

## What is a "Prototype"?

> A **prototype** is a fancy word that means a preliminary sketch of an idea or model for something new. 
> It's the original drawing from which something real *might* be built or created.

## Activity 

> Technological innovation is about recognizing a problem that needs to be solved, or recognizing something needs improving and then building a tool to solve it. 

In your groups each person should: 

- Identify some way that technology is used with, or affects your area of interest
- Make a suggestion for either:
    - a way that technology might be improved to make it better, faster, easier to use
    - a creative or innovative new technology might help solve some problem within that area, or at least make better?

## Rapid Prototyping 

In your group: 

- pick **ONE** of the ideas that was discussed
- Start to sketch out that idea on a poster 

**Remember**
- This is a rapid prototype, it is not meant to be super detailed.

## Wrap-up

[Computer Science is Changing Everything](https://youtu.be/1x54GqfL3UY)

On a sheet of paper answer one of the two following questions: 

- Select an innovation. Describe the positive and negative impacts it has had on the world. (A satisfactory answer reflects awareness and analysis of the effects on populations beyond the students’ immediately locale.)
- Speculate on how students 25 years from now will answer, "What computing innovation has had a significant impact on your life?" (A satisfactory answer includes a non-trivial consideration of how technology will likely change from, and perhaps build upon, what is currently available)
