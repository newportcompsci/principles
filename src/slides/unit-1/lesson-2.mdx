# Sending Binary Messages

---

## Think, Pair, Share 

> What is your personal definition of "information?" Take a minute to write it down.

---

# Get into Groups of Two

---

## Prompt

> Imagine that you and your friend have not been able to communicate for the entire summer, and you have a chance to ask her one binary question that she will answer. What binary question do you want to ask?

---

## Challenge 1: Send a Binary Message

You will have **5 minutes** to construct a device out of the provided supplies to send a simple
binary message, a question with one of two possible answers (i.e., yes or no). 

### Rules: 
- Your partner will be on the opposite side of the room
- No language (sign-language etc.)
- **No Projectiles!**

---

## Group Discussion

Would your device still work if:

- There was something in between you and your partner?
- You couldn’t see your partner?
- You were in a loud room?
- Your partner wasn’t paying attention?

---

## Challenge 2: Four possible Messages

Think about these things:

- Should you modify your device?
- Should you use it in a different way?
- Should you make a new device entirely?

---

## Challenge 3: Eight Possible Messages

---

## Challenge 4: N-Possible Messages

- Our alphabet only has 26-letters, yet we can spell many words
- Our number system only has 10 digits yet we can represent many numbers
- Think back to your simple two-state device. Could you simply use it differently, rather than modifying it?

## Wrap Up

> Could you use another group’s device to send your set of messages? Why or why not? What would you need to know from the other groups?

> Based on what you've seen in today's activity what do you think are the limitations on the kinds of information we can send with binary messages?
