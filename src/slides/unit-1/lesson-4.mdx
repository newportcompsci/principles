# Number Systems 

---

## Getting Started

> In your notebook or on a piece of paper, 
> write down as many ways as you can think of 
> to represent the **number 7**

---

## Circle-Triangle-Square Activity

---

## Challenge 1

> Using the **shapes** given to you and **three** places to work with: 

- Record all of the unique 3-place patterns you can find on your worksheet
- How many did you find? 

---

## Challenge 2

> Now that you have found all of the 3-place patterns your task is:

- To determine a **systematic** way to generate all the patterns 
- **Write** your rules on the worksheet 
  - Make sure your rules are clear and easy to read

---

## Challenge 2B

> Once you have your rules, trade your rules with another team.

> Follow your new rules **exactly** how they are written, were you able to generate all of the possible combinations?

## Wrap-Up

> You just made a Number System!

- Were some sets of rules easier to use than others? If so what do you think led to this difference?
- Do you think there are any limits to the number of symbols we could use to represent numbers? 
- What if we only had two symbols? What about 10?
